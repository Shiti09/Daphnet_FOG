# Daphnet Freezing of Gait (FoG) Prediction Project
In the healthcare and medical technology industry, early detection and prediction of movement disorders, such as Freezing of Gait (FoG), can significantly improve the quality of life for patients with conditions like Parkinson’s disease. Freezing of Gait is a debilitating symptom where a person suddenly feels as though their feet are glued to the ground, making it difficult to walk or move. Predicting FoG episodes in advance can enable timely interventions, such as auditory or visual cues, to help patients regain mobility and prevent falls.
The Daphnet Freezing of Gait Prediction project is an advanced AI-based solution designed to predict FoG episodes using sensor data. By leveraging the Daphnet FoG dataset, which includes motion sensor data from patients, this project employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network—a type of deep learning model—to analyze time-series data and predict FoG events with high accuracy. This tool has the potential to revolutionize wearable healthcare devices, providing real-time alerts to patients and caregivers, and improving clinical decision-making.

# Steps Taken for the Daphnet FoG Prediction Project
# Problem Definition:
Identified the need for early prediction of Freezing of Gait episodes to assist patients with Parkinson’s disease.

# Defined the goal: to predict FoG events using motion sensor data.

# Data Collection:
Utilized the Daphnet FoG dataset, which includes time-series data from accelerometers placed on the legs of patients.

# Data Preprocessing:
- Cleaned the sensor data by handling missing values and noise.
- Normalized the data to ensure consistent scales across sensor readings.
- Segmented the time-series data into windows to prepare it for LSTM input.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzed the distribution of FoG and non-FoG events in the dataset.
- Visualized sensor data patterns to identify trends.

# Feature Engineering:
- Extracted relevant features from the time-series data, such as mean, variance, and frequency-domain features.
- Prepared the data in a format suitable for LSTM input (3D tensor: samples, timesteps, features).

# Model Selection:
- Chose LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) as the primary model due to its ability to capture temporal dependencies in time-series data.
- Experimented with different architectures, such as stacked LSTMs or adding dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

# Model Training:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
- Trained the LSTM model on the preprocessed training data.
- Used techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize training.

# Model Evaluation:
- Evaluated the model’s performance on the test dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Analyzed the confusion matrix to understand the model’s ability to correctly predict FoG and non-FoG events.

# Business Value
The Daphnet Freezing of Gait Prediction project is not just a technical achievement but a life-changing tool for patients and healthcare providers. By predicting FoG episodes in real-time, this solution can:
- Improve patient safety: Prevent falls and injuries by providing timely alerts.
- Enhance quality of life: Enable patients to move more confidently and independently.
- Support clinical decision-making: Provide doctors and caregivers with actionable insights to tailor treatment plans.
- Drive innovation in wearable technology: Integrate with smart devices to offer real-time monitoring and assistance.
- This project demonstrates the power of AI and deep learning to transform healthcare, making it a valuable asset for medical technology companies, researchers, and caregivers.
